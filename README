Recidiv is a minimal Continuous Integration framework.
I use it in order to run the Redis CI.

In order to setup your CI edit the ci.conf file, finally run
the Tcl script just with:

    ./recidiv.tcl

Editing the config file should be easy.

This is a work in progress and while general is primarily targeted at
Redis needs, but your contributions are welcomed.
