Recidiv is a minimal Continuous Integration framework.
I use it in order to run the Redis CI.

To install tclsh8.5 and its libs on ubuntu 10.04, use following commands:
sudo apt-get install tcl8.5
sudo apt-get install tcllib

In order to setup your CI edit the example.conf file, finally run
the Tcl script just with:

    ./recidiv.tcl example.conf

Recidiv was designed to power the Redis CI environment at http://ci.redis.io
